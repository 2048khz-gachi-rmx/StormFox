MapLight
	- https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/engine/LightStyle
		engine.LightStyle(str) (Have to call render.RedownloadAllLightmaps() on changes for all clients)
		

- Snow storms look a bit tame
	More effects

- Serverside transision speed

- Clientside rain volume

Changelog:
- Fixed client-setting typ'o
- Added an invisible streetlight for already existing map-props.
- Added engine.LightStyle for maps without light_environment. (Thanks D.va for pointing out)
- Added options for clients to disable redownloadlightmaps, since it can cause lagspikes.
- Tweaked some effects.





Make the fog a separate condition that can be active regardless of the weather. 
Allow the fog’s properties (e.g. colors, density, etc) to be flexible.
Allow admins set the in-game time. (Kinda already added, but with lua. Need to make it more stable before adding the function)
Allow weather and time effects to be “edited”, with presets having a variety of settings (e.g. how bright the day is, how dark the night / rain is, etc). (‘Cloudy’ is going to be added later, allowing to set “darkness” on the map)
Create light source entities that do not depend on a model. (Don :D)
Create a 360 degree light source. (Kinda don’t want to. Gmod only supports 8 lightmaps at all time. The more entities I add the more people will spam)
Allow admins to control light source entities with the menu. (I’ll see if I can’t make a menu)
Allow light sources to be controlled via context menu.
Allow light sources to have different colors.
Create even darker nighttime versions of the aforementioned particles.
Make fog and clouds colorable whilst also allowing the admins to manipulate their density / opacity. (Not sure)
Allow game time to be synchronized to server time.
Add an animated texture for windows, could likely just use $texturescroll and a normal map (Sadly not doable, windows in Source are strange and don’t even have their position/size right)
Forcing a tonemap controller to be enabled would be nice (Next update, with the new lightsupport it should be fine)
(possibly?) force-creating an env_tonemap_controller when the game is initialized (Don’t think its possible, but I’ll try)


Changelog:
- Fixed cold breaths being shown inside
- Lowered the thunder-sounds
- Tweaked the lights a bit
- Rewrote sf_redownloadlightmaps fix lighterrors, while still supporting missing light_enviroment.
